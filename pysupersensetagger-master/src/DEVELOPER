The src/pyutil subdirectory of this project is actually imported from another project
(https://github.com/nschneid/pyutil) as a subtree. To contribute to the development of pyutil, 
clone that repository directly. To import recent changes from the pyutil repository into 
this project, use:

$ git remote add -f pyutil git://github.com/nschneid/pyutil.git
$ git pull -s subtree pyutil master
